# Second assignment by Coderhouse :computer:

Compared with the first assignment, this one it's more complete in terms of theroycal content.
The objective is to start with a simple project topic, and improve it while IÂ´m advance with the lessons by adding more resources and functionalities of JS.

### The topic that I chose for the project is a Coffeshop :coffee: 
<sub>Because I love it :sweat_smile:</sub>


The idea is making a **super simple** E-commerce, but this time i can use more things. These things are: functions and high-order functions, objects, methods and arrays. So, you cand read the code if you interested on how I implemented them.

#### A little disclaimer...
Since we dont saw the DOM lesson yet, the interact with the user it's very bounded. I can only use three functions to interact:
* `alert()`
* `prompt()`
* `console.log()/.table()`


## The highlight :star:
I think that the most important thing in this project is the logic behind the **cart** and **menu** arrays. It tooks me several hours to debugg the algorithms, and the worst/best thing is... the project is not ready yet. But once I finish with it, I think the result it's gonna be amazing. So...

#### ~~*IF YOU READ THIS MESSAGE THE PROJECT IT'S NOT DONE YET*~~
#### *THE PROJECT IS FINISHED :smiling_face_with_tear:*

On the other hand, the improvments I make will be updated in this :page_facing_up: README file in chronological order (the latest first and the oldest last)

### So don't hesitate to read it :arrow_down: :arrow_down: :arrow_down:
## Chronoligcal improvments list :clipboard:
### Latest
*14 of September 2022*

**a)** Function `modifyOrder()` were added. 
This function allows to change the amount of products in the order, by providing the products that you already has in the cart and letting input negative numbers in the `prompt()`. In case the order doesn't exists (you dont have any product in your cart), the program `alert()`s the user that he cannot modify an unexisting order.

**b)** Code reorganization.
The functios were separated with comentaries and empty lines of code into two groups depending on their "complexity", named as ***simple functions*** and ***complex functions***. The simples are the ones that not implements other functions declared by me within their blocks. Complex the ones that have one or more inside of their block code.

**c)** Names improvements. 
Changed a lot of functions and variables names to better understand its functionalities

**c)** Hotifixes.
Debugging proces. References and types error were corrected.

### Changes 3
*12 of September 2022*

**a)** The old menu system, which worked with a "switch" statement, was improved for a more scalable array/object based system. The functions related with the "switch menu system" were also updated to work correctly.

### Changes 2
*9 of September 2022*

**a)** The object {*`cart`*} was replaced by two arrays with new functionalities. 
The first array, [*`store`*], fulfills the function of storing the products with properties related to it (*name*, *price* and *stock*).
The second one, [*`cart`*], saves the products that the user wants to buy.

**b)** Stock functionality added. 
When the user saves the order, the program makes a check in the [*`store`*] list using the `checkStock()` function. This allows to save the order on [*`cart`*] in case there is stock available.

**c)** Console output improvement. 
The code that is responsible for display the results of the order on the console when the user enters to the *cart* option was improvement, making it more readeble.

### Changes 1
*3 of September 2022*

**a)** Creating the menus logic. 
The idea is create a function called `menu()` that works with a *switch* statement which checks the input and compares against the cases, so you can navigate trought the different options.

**b)** Create a cart object.
This object was created by the following structure [key, value] = [number, object]. Namely, the objects that correspond with the property values of the {*`cart`*} object, represents the products of the store. These objects also has properties (name, price and quantity) which are used to save the order and calculate the total.
